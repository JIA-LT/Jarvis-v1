# Jarvis v1 — Personal Knowledge & Decision Assistant (RAG)

A local-first, explainable RAG system that ingests Markdown notes and answers questions with citations.
Phase 1: local MVP (FastAPI + Qdrant + SQLite + Cloud LLM/Embeddings).
Phase 2: productionization on AWS/EKS (microservices, queue workers, Redis cache, observability).
Phase 3: data lake analytics (S3 + Glue + Athena) for usage, cost, and retrieval-quality insights.
